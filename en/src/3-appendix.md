## Acknowledgement 

lernOS Diversity & Inclusion was created with the help of many people
and came from many different sources. It is therefore a collaborative
work. The respective sources are listed in the Weeklys (weekly
instructions) and Katas (exercises) on the one hand and under Resources
on the other.

In addition, we would like to introduce the authors who developed the
guide.

Many thanks to Simon Dückert for the content-related, technical and
moral support!

The guide was written by: Pivi Scamperle, Nicole Knaack, Hans Jablonski,
Julia Dobbin, Frederike Fehsenfeld, Franziska Hacke, Julia Haupt, Betina
Psyk.

A big thank you for constructive feedback and corrections goes to:

## Glossary 

^1Barcamp^: A barcamp is an open event format, also called an
unconference or ad-hoc conference. The content and schedule of the
conference are still open at the beginning and are only determined on
site by the participants. You can find more information here:
<https://www.eventbrite.de/blog/barcamp-methode-definition-ablauf-regeln/#definition-barcamp-methode>

^2Sketchnoting^: The term is a compound of sketch (sketches) and note
(notes) - i.e. notes consisting of text, images and structures. The
creation of a sketchnote is called sketchnoting and is often used as an
alternative to conventional note-taking. You can find more information
here: <https://sketchnoting.net/>

**^3Expert^ Debriefing**: A method that serves to capture and structure
expert knowledge and thus make it further usable (for the company and/or
the succession). There is even a LernOS guide to this:
<https://cogneon.github.io/lernos-expert-debriefing/de/1-1-Geschichte-des-Expert-Debriefings/>

^5Weekly^: The Weekly is the weekly meeting that you or the group set
together. This meeting can take place either in person or virtually.

^6Kata^: In each week exercises are suggested to achieve the goal, these
are called katas.

**^7Learning^ Circle**: If you do not want to do lernOS alone, you can
join a group of 4-5 people. This group is called a Learning Circle. You
can find more information here:
<https://cogneon.github.io/lernos-for-you/de/1-3-lernOS-Circle/>

^8Sprint^: lernOS is practised in 13 weeks. Similar to Scrum, this
period is called a sprint. Further information can also be found here:

^9WOL^ **Working Out Loud**: WOL is a self-learning method and also an
attitude. The term was taken up by Bryce Williams in 2010 and further
developed into a method by John Stepper in 2015. More info here:
<https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_out_loud> and here:
<https://workingoutloud.com/de/home/>

**^10Elevator^ Pitch**: The Elevator Pitch is a method for a very short
summary of an idea. The focus is on the positive aspects. You can find

Reasonable Time Bound and helps as a method to formulate goals correctly

<https://www.strategy-lab.com/wie-helfen-mir-objectives-key-results-aka-okr-bei-der-erreichung-meiner-ziele>

^13NOOB^: Noob means newcomer or beginner and is a shortening of the
English word \"newbies\".

^14Brown^ **Paper**: Brown Paper is nothing more than a roll of wrapping
paper on which (due to its size) a process with all the important
process features is visualised with the help of sticky notes and pens.
Details can also be found here:
<https://www.business-wissen.de/hb/was-ist-die-brown-paper-methode/>

^15^ **Mind mapping**: Mind mapping is a method of organising thoughts
in the form of keywords, images, reference points, elements, etc. and
bringing them into relation to each other. Further information is
available at: [www.mindmapping.com](http://www.mindmapping.com)

^16ESN^: Enterprise Social Network - translated from English, it means
the social network or intranet of companies.

# Stop reading, start doing! 

If you have only read this guide so far, but are not yet actively using
lernOS, then you should start now! Getting started with lernOS is really
easy. Here are the five steps that will help you get started smoothly:

1.  Schedule time: Define the quarter in which you want to start with
    lernOS. Write down the times for the weekly in the calendar. This
    regular appointment is especially important if you practise lernOS
    in a Circle.

2.  Define objectives and key results: Use week 0 to set your goals and
    measurable outcomes for the sprint. Choose a goal that you really
    care about.

3.  Start a Circle: Look for 3-4 people who want to start a sprint in
    the same quarter. If someone has already been in another Circle,
    this person can take on the role of Circle facilitator.

4.  Organise the Weekly: If you don\'t know your Circle members, it\'s
    best to meet in person during week 0. Use social networks or
    messengers to communicate between meetings. Use video conferencing
    to organise virtual meetings.

5.  Plan, Do, Learn, Repeat: Use the last weekly in week 12 to reflect
    on the results and the cooperation in the circle. Decide whether you
    want to go through another sprint together.

**Keep Calm & Learn On!**
